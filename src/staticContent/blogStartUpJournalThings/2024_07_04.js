      This past month the main focus, the main event, was, in fact, an event. A conference. I attended CascadiaJS as my first tech conference. First thing I should say is, it was great and I highly recommend this one, but conferences in general as well, to anyone. I went with the personal goals of networking and learning, and some company (Galvanize coding bootcamp) goals of understanding the future of JS and AI tooling. It fealt like a dead sprint for 2 straight days in a good way. The talks were all great; mostly consisting of "AI is great, here's a RAG or some fun tool" or "AI is dangerous, here's how to protect yourself". Beyond the talks I got to meet a lot of nice, smart, and like minded people; I'd say I learned as much from them as I did the talks. Also, the food and swag were plentiful.
      
      A couple other quick, more recent notes...

      I started studying for the AWS solutions architect cert test. I'm following the same pattern as has worked for me in the past. This is signing up for a test 2 months out in order to light the fire, and signing up for a Udemy prescription and taking Stephane Maarek's course.

      My job search has really picked up speed since starting to network more, and especially the conference. But I'm not getting as many interviews as I'd like. While this could just be a result of the market right now, and I am mostly applying for senior positions which I think are likely getting a lot of actual-senior applicants, I still have to do what I can to improve my numbers. So I'm planning on two actions and will follow up with how they go. First is to start using an ATS support service, these basically format and keyword-ify your resume. The other is to take a more inbound marketing approach, meaning I'll build projects, give talks, write blogs, and go to events and post about it; in hopes recruiters come to me.
