        This last month's time has mostly been spent grinding on the AWS course. I see some of my recent bootcamp students posting about getting AWS certified and I think that I'm probably ready for the exam but have decided to continue the course as I think it's a good one; it's important to understand it thoroughly and get the reps in to solidify the memorization. 
        
        I've also been watching videos on the new tech stack I'd like to use for my next product. The tech stack is a Golang API via the Gin framework with a Vue.js frontend. I chose these as they are newer frameworks that seem to be picking up steam. I also wanted to challenge myself. I know this will slow down my product development, but despite going at half the pace it will also double dip in benefits for traditional (non entrepreneurial) employment in the future. What's most important is to increase growth rate, is to be outside of my comfort zone. Which I feel I've been spending too much time in lately. 

        When I started my last job, I learned Django, FastApi, Docker, and a rotating cast of cloud hosts. I'm ready to get back into that cadence and if I can maintain that pace of adoption I should be able to learn new languages and technologies at a speed needed for leading my own initiatives. I will need to branch out to new problems to solve however, rather than just learning a new way to write an API. But this is a good first step.
