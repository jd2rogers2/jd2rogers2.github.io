    Not too much to update on this month. I set a deadline to have a new job by the first of September so that's helped me put the pedal to the medal. And I started/have been keeping a dev journal. It needs a little organizing but it's just a text file repo where I can throw all of my notes. It's been good for reviewing to see the recurring patterns in leetcode problems, or to review one that had a sleek solution.
    
    I've also started doing this diet/exercise routine called "75 Hard" which is basically 75 days straight of 2-a-day workouts, drink 1 gallon of water, read 10 minutes of professional/personal development, and follow a diet. No breaks. It's easier than expected; my workouts actually brought me to the next level of stamina which is enough to sustain 2-a-days. As for the diet, my main flaw is binge/cheat days where I'll just unload a whole pack of oreos or something, so I really just need to not do that and I'll be good. With this, I've paused the activity tracker since this covers almost everything I was checking. The only exception is weekly budget meetings which have been moved to a calendar reminder.

    Last thing I'll mention here is that I said I would follow up with what I am using for a system design course. I chose "Grokking the System Design Interview" by design gurus, but so far, in the fundamentals level, it's really just a dictionary of terms. A little disappointing so far; hopefully it improves.
