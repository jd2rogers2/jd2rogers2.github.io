    Did I promise to start working on startup things by May? That was ambitious. Well if you think about it, this job search is foundational startup work. I've been thinking a lot about the phrase "what got you here won't get you there". Something I think I will need if I'm going to be a bigshot founder one day is good credentials. So that's why I'm pushing for a top company job to look good on the ol' CSV. 

    I have however actually started networking, which is my form of applying for jobs. I opt for the referal route; the high quality application, rather than a high quantity of applications. So in another couple of months I'll have a shiny new job and can get to startupy things.

    In the meantime, work has been reeeeally busy. I took this role of writing curriculum, only to have a rotating cast of 3-5 engineers/writers "assigned" to me. When I say "assigned" it's more like, they just joined our team out of the blue and my boss didn't really do anything with them, so I guess they're mine now. So it's been a bit of a tech lead role which has been nice in a way, once I realized that I need to be doing more managing than contributing.

    Sorry it's another light one, life doesn't move as fast as you want it to sometimes. And sometimes you don't do the things you should do even though you know you should.

    Hasta pronto!
