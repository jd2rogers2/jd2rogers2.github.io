        Today I'm here with a couple big updates. First of which is that I got married. We flew to Ireland and eloped with just a couple of friends in attendance. What a great trip and I'm so lucky to have found my person.

        The other news is that I passed my first AWS certification exam. I am now a certified Cloud Practitioner, whatever that means haha. So with that I'm going to speak quickly about a couple workflow tips that worked well for me.
        
        The first tip is that you really have to put consistent time in. It sounds obvious but with life happening it's not always easy. 5 back to back days, with the right strategy, is much more effective than 5 spaced out days. After a couple of months putting in a little time here and there I knew I needed a shot in the arm. I committed and booked a test. After doing this I was much more motivated. But what really took it to the next level was finding longer blocks of time during the day to dive even deeper in longer focus stretches. I'm usually a morning person but with my current job starting at 8, I was only able to put an hour in before work so I switched to a after dinner study period and I think it paid off. Lastly, something I'll always do going forward is chunking my knowledge into blocks; as in when I was learning AWS services separately I was making slow progress but when I wrote out small descriptions for each of the services named "gateway" I was able to remember each much better.

        After this success comes the excitement of the next thing. I'm in the process of weighing the pros and cons of it out but I'm leaning towards more AWS certs. One thing I would like is to find a more communal and accountable platform than udemy for my studies this time around.
