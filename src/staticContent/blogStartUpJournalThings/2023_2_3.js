        Well I just wrapped up writing my new personal page (what you're on currently, here's the source code https://github.com/jd2rogers2/jd2rogers2.github.io) and I'm really happy with it. It was the first step in my plan for total world domination.

        You gotta shoot high, and if all doesn't go as planned I'm hoping it'll at least land me with some great experience and the ability to level up quickly to a Tech Lead or Eng Manager position. Ok so total world domination isn't exactly my plan (maybe you've already figured this out as it doesn't really have transferable skillz with tech management).

        The destination is building my own startup. The journey includes leveling up my cloud/AWS skillz with all the certs I can get my hands on, all the while building and deploying projects or portfolio apps, taking some data sci courses, and lastly, when I feel like I have the hard skillz necessary, taking a startup course (ycombinator has one that looks interesting startupschool.org).

        Well, welcome to my journey that's likely to be long, hard fought, and hopefully fun. I hope you enjoy and can learn something from it.
