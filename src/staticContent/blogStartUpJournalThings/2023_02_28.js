        So it's been almost a month and, outside of the ol' 9-5, here's what I've done:

        - built a node and react app that I intend to use as a demo app during my aws course (and learned a little bit about migrations in node, specifically with node-pg-migrate)
        - started a udemy aws course. learning IAM and some EC2 so far
        - continued volunteer tech leading for a stealth mode nonprofit startup

        And well this isn't enough for me. I was hoping to be finished with the AWS course by now. So I've been mulling over some tweaks and I thought this might be a good place to weigh them up.

        The biggest blocker is the stealth mode nonprofit startup. It (civic coding in general is an incredible place for anyone looking to test their skillz) has been a great environment for me to practice being a Tech Lead. Considering my experience, there's nowhere else that could I have gained [semi] real world experience architecting a data schema, leading a team of junior devs, and making management level product decisions. However... yeah this is hard because, as you can see, I've put a lot into it over the past 2 years and gotten a lot out of it ...it is taking up a lot of my time. What it comes down to is what is a better use my time. As part of this startup journey I have to be able to take emotion out of the equation. I can also genuinely say that most of the products I have come up with during startup brainstorm sessions are mission driven initiatives. 

        All this to say, quitting will be hard but I think it's what I need to do. Not to mention I need some more free time to also look for a new job.

        As I just mentioned, another tweak I'm going to make is to start looking for a new job. I'm currently teaching at a bootcamp. This has been really rewarding but between the itch to get back out there building, the less flexibility with my schedule, and the fact that it's really a 8-5:30 situation, I think it's time to move on. 

        Well that's all I have time for today. So my goals to accomplish before my next blog:

        - start the job search train
        - leave the volunteer gig **sigh** (but also good practice for someday having to make tough decisions/actions)
        - redouble my efforts with AWS class

        Tata!
