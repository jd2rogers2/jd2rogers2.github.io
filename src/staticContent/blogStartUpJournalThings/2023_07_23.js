        Here comes another dose of James' stream of consciousness writing that will likely never be read by a single soul. This time I'm here to tell you about my next step of taking the AWS Certified Developer test.
        
        This is the test that I am most excited about, but also feel the most skeptical of. As a developer this one is the most relevant to what I do and will help me learn to deploy my code in AWS. However, passing these tests in any sort of realistic timeframe does not allow for hands on learning. I'd love to build a small MERN app or whatever and spend a week deploying in each of the 10-15 different services that the test content covers; and I hope I do this once I've completed my associates certs. This, though, would take forever and would still not cover all of the services needed to pass the test. And it's this sentiment that makes me skeptical of these tests as a whole. That said, they look good on a resume and learning is fun. 

        It's a short one today, but I want to finish with a quick recap of how this fits into my "become an entrepreneur" track; if for no other reason than my own accountability. Loosely the track looks like this: AWS > projects > data sci school > startup school. I'm starting with AWS so I have a base of skillz that will allow me to build products of all kinds and make them publicly available. There can be no better way to learn than to actually build something. With this I'll start simple and with a tech stack I already know, and incrementally get more complex. I'd love to continue making these products even more complex by adding in data science and machine learning. Lastly, if and when I don't take one of those products public, I'll dive into the business side. I know ycombinator has a cool class, that could be a good place to start.
