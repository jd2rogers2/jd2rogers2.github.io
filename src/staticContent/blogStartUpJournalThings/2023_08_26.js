        Well I passed my second AWS certification. Specifically the Certified Developer Associate test. It certainly wasn't easy, though this being my second, I did know what I was getting into this time. I got another 80, which I'm happy with considering I only studied for 1 month for this one. I followed the same strategy as last time that I've outlined a fair bit in earlier posts.

        About 3 weeks before the big day I took a practice test and scored a passing grade and it was a 20 point increase on the previous practice test. Unfortunately, this, and some summer plans, made me complacent. 1 week before the big day I took another practice round and received around a 60. I was going to fail! Well obviously I put in plenty of extra hours in the week leading up to it and probably 8-10 hours on the day prior.

        A couple quick gripes I'd like to get off my chest: 1) the practice tests I took on Udemy by Neal Davis were worded confusingly and with sometimes downright incorrect English. This was dissappointing and surprising given the practice tests for the Cloud Practitioner were excellent. 2) I took the test remotely (not at a testing center) and had another poor experience. The sortware or my connection cut out at least 6 times, which is a huge disruptor. It meant spending extra team rereading the long questions.

        I'm thankful that I was able to pass due to a lot of things like great family, friends, and coworkers; but also because I have learned how to study and how to learn over the years. College was a breeze for me so I did minimal work outside of the classroom, and then when it came to finals it was all cramming with Oreo filled marathon weekends. It did the trick but it was not enjoyable or retained. Working as an instructor for the last year has helped me learn how to learn. This is something I'd recommend to anyone with ambition.

        I recently heard some phrasing about having a growth mindset that I hadn't heard before and it hit me like a eureka moment. I have always enjoyed putting in the work during practice when it comes to soccer. I really just love the game and that makes it easy when it comes to game time. During my recent studies I was feeling burnt out and having trouble with my focus and mental energy. Then I heard this growth mindset perspective and everything changed. I was told to shift your outlook during those moments, when you're putting in the hard work studying, from one of tiredness to almost pride to give yourself a little dopamine hit in that moment to reinforce that this hard work is a positive experience. Even better, I now go into a study session thinking "this hour or 2 is going to help me get better so let's enjoy that".

        My AWS cert journey doesn't end here but I am going to pause to really cement what I've learned into my brain. Unlike my time at college, I'd like to have these concepts (of which there are a lot!) really solidify so I'm not going to do the Solutions Architect right away. I'm going to be working on a web product which I will then deploy to the AWS cloud!!
