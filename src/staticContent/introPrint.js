    G'day and welcome!
    I'm James Rogers, thanks for visiting my page.

    Coding and all things web dev are my passion so I built this site so the world can know a little bit more about what I've done.

    There's a blog, some links to me on other platforms, and a resume in here somewhere. Use the commands below to dive in. Enjoy!

    Commands available:
    pwd, ls, cd, cat, echo, clear, dark, light
