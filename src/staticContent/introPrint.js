    G'day and welcome!
    I'm James Rogers, thanks for visiting my page.

    Coding and all things web dev are my passion so I built this site so the world can know a little bit more about what I've done.

    If you want to see this message again use the "welcome" or "help" commands.

    There's a blog, some links to me on other platforms, and a resume in here somewhere.
